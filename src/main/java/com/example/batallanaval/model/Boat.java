 * This class represents a specific implementation of a boat used in the Naval Battle game.
 * It extends {@link BoatAdapter} and initializes a boat's size, resistance, orientation, and graphical shape.
 *
 * Each boat object holds its visual representation (shape), initial resistance (i.e., health),
 * orientation (horizontal or vertical), and a position on the game board.
 *
 * The visual shape is represented as a {@link Group} object, which allows JavaFX rendering of the boat.
