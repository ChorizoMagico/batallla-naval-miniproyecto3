[33m10384ba[m[33m ([m[1;31morigin/jeas[m[33m)[m Refactoring the preparationView controller. Now, all the placing of the boats is made in LogicBoard and the controller only shows it. There is something wrong with it, thought. The first boat is placed too low and the next boat doesnt show. It must be fixed
[33mec6bbec[m The boats are now ImageViews created with shapes
[33mc8254c9[m Most of the errors fixed. Changed the two events to apply to all available boats and all the nodes in the grid pane. Now the available boats are a HashMap for error reasons. There is a extrange error when clicking an empty noad, it must be fixed
[33m931fd0b[m Creates a preparation view in which the position of the boats will be selected
